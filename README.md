# freelancer template using vue.js/vuetify 

This repository contains a template I use for my website.
It uses some nice vue tricks, contains a blogging function
that creates html from markdown.

# Live Demo
[www.celp.de](https://www.celp.de)

# Usage
I love one-button-build scripts, all my scripts work like that.
## Development
Start the local dev. environment with
```
./develop.sh
```
You need docker installed, nothing else.
## Deployment
Publish the current version with
```
./publish.sh
```
Well, you'll need to change the target host since you may not
rsync to my webserver ;-)


# disclaimer
I got some inspiration from this template:
